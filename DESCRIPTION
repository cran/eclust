Description: Companion package to the paper: An analytic approach for 
    interpretable predictive models in high dimensional data, in the presence of 
    interactions with exposures. Bhatnagar, Yang, Khundrakpam, Evans, Blanchette, Bouchard, Greenwood (2017) <DOI:10.1101/102475>. 
    This package includes an algorithm for clustering high dimensional data that can be affected by an environmental factor. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.1)
